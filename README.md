In this project I made a game using Tkinter for the GUI interface and SQLite for the database. The dataset is formed of 5 main topics from science (informatics, mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry) and a general one from all of them. A quiz consist of 10 questions 
with 4 variants from where just one is correct. The user can insert their name and at the end a score will be calculated depending on the correct answers. The result is displayed at the end with other options regarding the game.
I used pytest with 45 automated tests.
